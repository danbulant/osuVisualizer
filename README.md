# Osu visualizer

I like to listen to my osu beatmaps, and also like to have them on background. Thus, this osu!visualizer was born.

It automatically plays and visualizes your beatmaps, with zero config to do. Currently, it randomly shufles through all of your beatmaps (no option to filter, yet), and you can only play/pause, skip and control the volume (using alt+scroll).

Currently, only working on windows (other platforms have different paths, so they won't work. PRs open though.).
